# PiNexaTech Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions for deploying PiNexaTech in various environments, including development, staging, and production.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying PiNexaTech, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Git installed on your system
- Node.js and npm installed
- Docker installed (for containerization)
- Access to required databases (PostgreSQL and MongoDB)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/PiNexaTech.git
cd PiNexaTech
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Modify the `.env` file in the root directory to include the necessary environment variables for your deployment environment. Ensure that you provide values for variables such as database connection strings, API keys, etc.

### 3. Build Docker Images (if applicable)

If you are deploying PiNexaTech using Docker containers, build the Docker images for each component:

```
docker-compose build
```

### 4. Start the Application

Start PiNexaTech using Docker Compose:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will start all the required services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file in detached mode.

### 5. Verify Deployment

Once the deployment is complete, verify that PiNexaTech is running correctly by accessing the provided endpoints and performing basic functionality tests.

## Additional Deployment Considerations

- **Environment-specific Configuration**: Ensure that you configure environment-specific settings such as database connection strings, API keys, and logging levels for each deployment environment (development, staging, production).

- **Scaling**: Depending on the anticipated workload, you may need to scale PiNexaTech components horizontally by running multiple instances behind a load balancer.

- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement monitoring and logging solutions to track the health, performance, and usage of PiNexaTech in production environments.

- **Security**: Harden the deployment environment by implementing security best practices, such as using HTTPS for communication, securing sensitive data, and regularly updating dependencies.

## Conclusion

By following these deployment instructions and considerations, you can effectively deploy PiNexaTech in various environments, ensuring that it operates reliably, securely, and efficiently to meet the needs of your application or platform.
