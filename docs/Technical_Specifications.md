# PiNexaTech Technical Specifications

This document provides an overview of the technical architecture, design decisions, and underlying technologies used in PiNexaTech.

## Architecture

PiNexaTech follows a modern microservices architecture, comprising several independent modules that communicate with each other via APIs. The architecture is designed to be scalable, resilient, and easily maintainable.

### Components

1. **Authentication Service**: Responsible for user authentication and token generation.
2. **User Management Service**: Handles user registration, profile management, and user-related operations.
3. **Data Service**: Manages the storage and retrieval of data objects within the system.

## Design Decisions

1. **Modularity**: PiNexaTech is designed as a collection of loosely coupled modules, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling of individual components.
   
2. **API-First Approach**: All interactions with PiNexaTech are through a RESTful API, promoting interoperability and ease of integration with other systems.

3. **Token-Based Authentication**: Token-based authentication is used to secure API endpoints, providing a stateless and scalable authentication mechanism.

4. **Database Choice**: PiNexaTech utilizes a relational database for user management and a NoSQL database for flexible data storage.

5. **Containerization**: Docker containers are used for packaging and deploying PiNexaTech components, ensuring consistency across different environments.
